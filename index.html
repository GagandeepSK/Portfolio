                            Before the development of the actual Proof of Concept (POC), I played a key role in designing the motor mount and casing for the Electrodynamic Wheel (EDW). This pre-development phase was crucial for anticipating and addressing potential issues.
                             The utilization of CAD software, specifically Fusion 360, proved invaluable, especially during motion studies. The CAD model closely resembled the test rig employed to measure the lift vector generated by magnetic fields. 
                            In this setup, the force was measured by a mass scale, providing a comprehensive visualization of the system. (Click the Image)
