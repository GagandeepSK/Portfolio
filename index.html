                    <p>
                        I am a dedicated engineering student at the University of Warwick, passionate about pushing the boundaries of mechanical engineering through innovation and hands-on experience. 
                        Currently, I am an Engineering Intern at Siemens Energy, developing solutions for SGT-A65 turbines. My diverse experiences include optimizing mechanical pumps at Severn Trent Water, refining maglev propulsion for Warwick Hyperloop, and 
                        leading the Pathways Team at my university. I have also gained industry insights through the HSBC HeadStart Programme and contributed to Warwick Racing. Committed to engineering excellence, I mentor future engineers with the Tutorfair Foundation and strive to create impactful solutions for tomorrow.

                        <p>
                            Before the development of the actual Proof of Concept (POC), I played a key role in designing the motor mount and casing for the Electrodynamic Wheel (EDW). This pre-development phase was crucial for anticipating and addressing potential issues.
                             The utilization of CAD software, specifically Fusion 360, proved invaluable, especially during motion studies. The CAD model closely resembled the test rig employed to measure the lift vector generated by magnetic fields. 
                            In this setup, the force was measured by a mass scale, providing a comprehensive visualization of the system. (Click the Image)
